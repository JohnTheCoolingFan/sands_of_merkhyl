# Sun never sets on the sands of Merkhyl

Short internal name: Sands of Merkhyl or just Sands

## World setting

Merkhyl is a desert planet, entirely covered in sand. It is placed between two suns, so it's lit up from both sides. There is only a small amount of less bright time in which you can somewhat sleep and relax while the temperature ever so slightly goes down. The last survivors are scattered around the planet, some formed villages and settlements, some travel either on their bare feet or motor vehicles. You are a group of such survivors. You have a convoy of one big truck and a couple of regular cars. One day you encounter an abandoned mining platform. Finally, you have something that can protect you from the sun and provide a place to rest. You start settling in the platform, which has many things broken but repairable. You disassemble your machines to repair the basic systems, and one day you have started the engines and made the tracks move. This is where your journey to explore the  planet starts.

Sometimes you get a radio transmission from someone, it's a wandering trader, a group of survivors just like your group was, wandering about the planet wishing to trade goods. You can buy parts of equipment there for your resources or currency.

Not everyone is friendly in the desert. At times raiders will notice your big platform and decide to try their luck at taking it over. They ride on cars that are repaired by scrap so many times it's surprising how it still drives. They attack you with their firearms or guns mounted on vehicles sometimes. You have to defend from them and not let them inside. Hopefully you have enough firepower by that time...

In your journey you  stumble upon resource spots. Since you're on a mining platform, why not try and mine them? You can then sell it to someone looking for resources who can then process these into industrial or scrap components.
